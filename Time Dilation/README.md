# GUI-Based Time Dilation Project

Welcome to the GUI-Based Time Dilation Project! This project is designed to visualize and calculate time dilation effects using a graphical user interface (GUI) built with Python and Pygame.

## Overview

Time dilation is a concept from the theory of relativity, which describes how time can slow down for objects moving at high speeds or in strong gravitational fields. This project provides an interactive way to understand and visualize these effects.

## Features

- Interactive GUI for visualizing time dilation effects
- Input fields for velocity and gravitational strength
- Real-time calculation and display of time dilation
- Educational and easy-to-use interface
